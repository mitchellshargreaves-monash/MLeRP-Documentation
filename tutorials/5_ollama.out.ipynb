When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\\n2. These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\\n3. The shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more than longer red wavelengths because they have a higher energy and interact more strongly with the gas molecules.\\n4. As a result, our eyes perceive the scattered blue light as a blue color, making the sky appear blue.\\n\\nThis scattering effect is most pronounced when the sun is overhead (at an angle of about 90 degrees), which is why the sky often appears more vibrant blue during midday. As the sun sets or rises lower in the sky, the light has to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, which means more of the shorter wavelengths are scattered away, making the sky appear more orange or red due to the dominance of the longer wavelengths.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: the sky appears blue because of the scattering of short blue wavelengths by tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere!\\n\\n(P.S. There are other factors that can affect the apparent color of the sky, such as dust particles, water vapor, and pollution.
