The Machine Learning eResearch Platform (MLeRP) creates a middle ground that has the interactivity of a notebook with the power of a GPU Cluster environment that can share valuable resources between other users while code isnâ€™t being executed.

We provide users with CPU based Jupyter notebook sessions capable of basic analysis, with the ability to interactively send jobs to a SLURM queue for GPU or parallelised CPU acceleration through Dask.

Be sure to check out the [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) and [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) documentation for more information.

MLeRP is available through open beta to all Australian and New Zealand researchers working with machine learning. You can sign up with your institutional email address through the button below to gain access to the MLeRP platform or join our mailing list for updates.
